    <h4 class="poem">"Heal depression through real action"<br><br>
        They say happiness will find you, but I think sadness will find you too.<br>
        But be careful in balancing the two, you may not be able to get through.<br>
        So much sadness brings you to darkest, it will turn stars to its dimmest.<br>
        Darkness is now what you seek, it paves way to depression at its peak.<br><br>
        
        Depression is not a joke, you feel like you're broke,<br>
        you look like you're choke, you suffer like you're stroke.<br>
        In the depths where shadows reign, Lies a world consumed by endless pain.<br>
        A silent ache that no words impart, A heavy burden, a shattered heart.<br><br>
        
        All the smiles on your face you have lied, when the pain in your heart you had to hide.<br>
        To your soul you are no more kind, if you become the slave of your own mind.<br>
        All the laughter’s on your mouth you’ve fake, when words left unspoken for others sake.<br>
        To your life you are no longer alive, if you let your heart be deprive.<br><br>
        
        Depression makes me mad; depression makes me sad.<br>
        Depression makes me bad, depression is unbelievingly hard.<br>
        It is a serious mental illness, it greatly affects your wellness,<br>
        you should avoid carelessness, to heal this severe sickness.<br><br>
        
        Healing implies kindness, healing means changes.<br>
        Healing takes time, but you can do it anytime.<br>
        Begin by having sense of satisfaction, Sense of balance and so on,<br>
        self-care of the whole person, and positive relation.<br><br>
        
        If you have problems don't run, rather face the light of sun,<br>
        whether you’re in one-on-one, but learn to enjoy and have fun.<br>
        Because life is not lame, it is a tricky game,<br>
        all people are facing the same, but react on different lane.<br><br>
        
        No matter how many times you’ve tried, no matter how many times you’ve cried.<br>
        No matter how many times you’ve fight, no matter how many times you’ve feel tight.<br>
        Believe in yourself that one day you’ll shine, after every hardship you’ll be fine.<br>
        Believe in God that one day you’ll rise, after every challenges there’s price.<br><br>
        
        So let compassion be the guiding voice, To heal the wounds, to make a choice.<br>
        For in the midst of shadows deep within, Hope persists—a new dawn begins.<br>
        Slowly, colors return to life's grand stage, Melodies of joy replace the silent cage.<br>
        Embracing imperfections, flaws, and scars, Reclaiming light from the dimmest stars.<br>

    <h4 class="poem">Pagmamahal<br><br>
        Ang pagmamahal ay parang bulaklak,<br>
        Namumukadkad at namumulaklak,<br>
        Nagbibigay galak sa pusong wasak,<br>
        At pag-asa sa taong walang balak.<br><br>
        
        Sa mundong kay ganda at malawak,<br>
        Hindi mo mamamalayan ang patak,<br>
        Sa lakas ng luhang tumatagaktak,<br>
        Ng taong nagmamahal na winasak.<br><br>
        
        Ang pagmamahal ay parang bula,<br>
        Nawawala ito bigla bigla.<br>
        Minsan iniiwan ka sa gitna,<br>
        Sa mga taong hindi pa handa.<br><br>
        
        Sa mundong puno ng pag-aalinlangan,<br>
        Hindi mo lubos na maiintindihan,<br>
        Ang tunay at totoong nagmamahalan,<br>
        Kung hindi ka lalabas sa 'yong kulungan.<br><br>
        
        Ang pagmamahalan ay walang katiyakan,<br>
        Sa mundong puno ng pangangailangan,<br>
        'Di mo alam ika'y pinagsasamantalahan,<br>
        At inaabuso ang iyong kabutihan.<br>

    <h4 class="poem">Love<br><br>
        Love is sometimes unpredictable,<br>
        Some find it as a miracle,<br>
        Some find it too painful,<br>
        Some find it beautiful.<br><br>
        
        When life is unfavorable,<br>
        It will make you comfortable.<br>
        When life is unstable,<br>
        It will make you responsible.<br><br>
        
        When love became too hurtful,<br>
        Stop it and be mindful,<br>
        'Cause you're not unbreakable,<br>
        You're a human who's vulnerable.<br><br>
        
        When love became too humble,<br>
        Keep it and be respectful,<br>
        'Cause you're not invisible,<br>
        You're a human who's grateful.<br>
